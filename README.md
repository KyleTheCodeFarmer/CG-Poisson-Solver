# CG-Poisson-Solver
2D Poisson Equation Solver using Conjugate Gradient and SOR Methods with OpenMP Parallelization

## Development Log

### Setup Grid and Matrix-Free Operator (`compute_Ax`)

- Created a 2D grid on the domain `[0, 1] x [0, 1]`.
- Used `idx(i, j, Nx)` to map 2D indices to 1D array indices.
- Implemented `compute_Ax()`.
- This computes `A*x` without explicitly constructing the matrix `A`.
- The operator corresponds to the finite-difference approximation of `-laplacian`.
- To check this operator, I used the example `phi_exact = sin(pi x) sin(pi y)`.
- Verified the implementation by comparing `A*phi_exact` with `rhs`.

For the center-point check, I obtained:

```text
rhs(center)        = 19.7385
Aphi_exact(center) = 19.7382
